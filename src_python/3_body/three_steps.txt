### for a testrun, do the following:

i)  generate helion basis: python3 ./NextToNewestGeneration.py <out_DIR> <nbr_of_processorcores> -1 1

=> mm-postprocessing files are stored in: '/scratch/compton_IRS/out_DIR/results'
=> '/tmp/out_DIR' is created anew for each run; preexisting folders are *deleted*

ii) generate a pair of final-state bases: python3 ./NextToNewestGeneration.py <out_DIR> <nbr_of_processorcores> 1 2

=> mm-postprocessing files are added to: '/scratch/compton_IRS/out_DIR/results'
=> '/tmp/out_DIR' is created anew for each run; preexisting folders are *deleted*

ii)  run: python3 A3_lit_M.py <out_DIR> <nbr_of_processorcores> <1st fs scenario> <last fs scenario>

iii) post process the output in ~/scratch/compton_IRS/out_DIR/results using the pertinent mm notebook
